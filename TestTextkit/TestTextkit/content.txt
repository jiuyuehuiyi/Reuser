Text Kit Demo
This is a demo of **Text Kit** you can change the system font size in **Setting** app at path _Settings General Text Size_. And in you app, you SHOULD set the font of `TextView` with method `preferredFontForTextStyle` instead of ~~fontWithName~~
As you can see at the Title, is it nice? itâ€™s an effect naming **Letterpress**. Also, you can use `UITextStorage` `UILayoutManager` and `UITextContainer` to supports more complex text layout. Thanks **Apple** and thanks the `Text Kit` .
